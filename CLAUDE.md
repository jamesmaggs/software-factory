# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this repo is

A personal collection of skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).
Each skill is authored to the portable [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification)
spec so it stays agent-agnostic. Skills live under `skills/<skill>/`:

```
skills/<skill>/
├── SKILL.md          # the skill: frontmatter (name, description) + instructions
└── evals/            # scenario evals (task.md, criteria.json, scenario.json, inputs/)
```

## Conventions

- Keep each `SKILL.md` compliant with the Agent Skills spec — skills must stay
  portable, not Claude-specific.
- When adding, renaming, or removing a skill, keep the [README](./README.md)
  Skills table in sync. Keep the skills in this table in alphabetical order.
- A `SKILL.md` is runtime instruction, not a changelog. Keep it imperative —
  no rationale, justification, or "why we did it" commentary. Be ruthless.
  Would removing content change what the executing agent does? If no, it's
  commentary — cut it. If yes, keep it, but phrase it as the directive, not
  the reason. Record the reasoning in the commit message.
- Commit with Conventional Commits; prefer small, atomic commits.

## Skill linting

The `skill-linter` skill's `skills/skill-linter/scripts/lint_skill.sh` checks a
`SKILL.md` against the Agent Skills spec (frontmatter delimiters, required
`name`/`description`, the `name` charset and directory match, field length
limits, body present, plus reference-nesting and best-practice heuristics). A
pre-commit hook runs it on every top-level skill — enable it once per clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Run it manually on a single skill: `bash skills/skill-linter/scripts/lint_skill.sh
<skill-dir> [--json]`.
