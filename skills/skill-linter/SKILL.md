name: skill-linter
description: Runs fast, deterministic, rule-based checks on a SKILL.md against the official Agent Skills spec (frontmatter limits, body length, one-level-deep references, path style, time-sensitive content) and reports errors plus heuristic warnings. Use when the user wants to lint, validate, check, or spec-check a skill, fix frontmatter problems, or verify a skill before publishing, even if they just say "check my SKILL.md". For judging writing quality or whether a skill actually improves task performance, use skill-evaluator instead.

# Skill Linter

Mechanically check a skill against the parts of the Agent Skills spec that can be
decided without judgement. This is a linter, not a critic: it tells you whether a
skill is *well-formed*, not whether it is *good* or *effective*. For those, use
`skill-evaluator`.

## How to run

The script is the source of truth. Run it, then relay what it reports — do not
form your own opinion of the skill by reading the file.

```bash
bash scripts/lint_skill.sh <path-to-skill-dir> [--json]
```

It exits `0` when there are no errors (warnings are allowed), `1` when any error
is found, and `2` if the path can't be read. Use `--json` to parse the result
programmatically; otherwise read the human-readable report.

Always run the script; never substitute a read-through. Several checks turn on
exact quantities a reader cannot judge by eye — the description length in
characters, the body length in lines, reserved-word matching — and eyeballing is
exactly where those get missed. After running it, report the verdict line and the
specific errors and warnings it printed, quoting its findings rather than
paraphrasing your own impression of the file.

## How to interpret the output

Each check is `error`, `warning`, or passing.

- **Errors** are violations of the spec's hard rules (name charset and length,
  reserved words, the 1024-char description limit, missing frontmatter). A skill
  with errors should not be published until they are fixed.
- **Warnings** are best-practice heuristics (third-person description, a "when"
  cue, body under 500 lines, one-level-deep references, no time-sensitive text).
  They need a human's judgement, not blind obedience.

Report the verdict and walk the user through each error and warning. For warnings,
say *why* the rule exists so they can decide whether it applies, rather than
treating every flag as a defect.

## Warnings are heuristics, so expect the occasional false positive

The text-based checks pattern-match; they cannot read intent. A `time-sensitive`
flag might be a deliberate "old patterns" note; a `desc-third-person` flag might
be a quoted user phrase. When a warning looks wrong, say so and explain why,
rather than forcing a change that makes the skill worse.

## What this skill does NOT do

It does not assess calibration (is the body lean, or padded with things the model
already knows?), description triggering quality, or whether the skill beats a
no-skill baseline on real tasks. Those are judgement and measurement, which is
`skill-evaluator`'s job. Run this first for a clean bill of form, then reach for
`skill-evaluator` for substance.

Checks are grounded in Anthropic's Agent Skills best-practices and spec
(`platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills`).
